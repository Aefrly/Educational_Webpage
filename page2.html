                <p>I love arctic foxes! However they are on the 
                    endangered species list as climate change is 
                    melting the ice in the arctic and therefore the 
                    foxes are unable to get the food they need to 
                    survive and repopulate.

                    <h4>Hunting</h4>
                    <p>When they are hunting, they can track the 
                        movements of mice and other rodents under 
                        the snow by feeling the vibrations. Then,
                        once the mouse stops moving, the arctic fox 
                        jumps up in the air before coming back down 
                        and pouncing on its prey to stun them.
