            <h1>Welcome to the Arctic!</h1>
            <p>This region on Earth is definitely one of the coldest 
                but it is home to some of the most interesting (and 
                adorable) animals on Earth. On this website, I will 
                introduce you to some of the animals and their unique
                qualities.

                <h3>Where are we?</h3>
                <p>To begin, we need to figure out where we are. Many
                      people may not know but the Arctic region is the
                      northernmost region on Earth. This is completely
                      different from Antarctica which is the 
                      southernmost continent. Below is a map of the 
                      Arctic region.
